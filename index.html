			Hi There! My name is Antonio. I am a senior at the University of Califoria - Berkeley studying Computer Science. Originally from Los Angeles, CA coming to Berkeley was a big change. I did not know what to expect but I soon became accustomed and came to enjoy the bay area. At Berkeley I discovered the art of Computer Science and became intrigued by the many things you can do as a computer scientist. After taking my first computer science class I realized that it was something I wanted to do and the rest is history. Since my exposure to computer science I have built cool projects, helped teach the data structures course and spent a summer interning as a Software Engineer at NetSuite. My time as a college student is coming to an end but my journey is just beginning!

						This past summer I got the oppurtunity to be part of and build for the Supply Chain Management team at NetSuite. As an engineer I was responsible for fixing bugs that were present in the current release as well as fix other issues that were reported by customers. I also got the oppurtunity to work on my own feature which was released to thousands of customers around the world. Half way through the summer Netsuite got acquired by Oracle so that was a pretty cool experience

					<p>
						For two semesters I assisted the student staff in teaching my favorite computer science course at UC Berkeley, Data Structures (Better known as CS61B)! As an academic intern I got the oppurtunity assist students in a variety of ways. This included helping students debug their projects, homework and labs, writing pre-labs reports that would help students better understand and complete their labs and help students with theorical and practical understanding of material
