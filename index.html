			Hi There! My name is Antonio. I am a senior at the University of Califoria - Berkeley studying Computer Science. Originally from Los Angeles, CA coming to Berkeley was a big change. I did not know what to expect but I soon became accustomed and came to enjoy the bay area. At Berkeley I discovered the art of Computer Science and became intrigued by the many things you can do as a computer scientist. After taking my first computer science class I realized that it was something I wanted to do and the rest is history. Since my exposure to computer science I have built cool projects, helped teach the data structures course and spent a summer interning as a Software Engineer at NetSuite. My time as a college student is coming to an end but my journey is just beginning!

						This past summer I got the oppurtunity to be part of and build for the Supply Chain Management team at NetSuite. As an engineer I was responsible for fixing bugs that were present in the current release as well as fix other issues that were reported by customers. I also got the oppurtunity to work on my own feature which was released to thousands of customers around the world. Half way through the summer <a href="http://www.netsuite.com/portal/home.shtml">NetSuite</a> got acquired by Oracle so that was a pretty cool experience

						For two semesters I assisted the student staff in teaching my favorite computer science course at UC Berkeley, Data Structures (Better known as 
						<a href="http://datastructur.es/sp17/">CS61B</a>

						)! As an academic intern I got the oppurtunity assist students in a variety of ways. This included helping students debug their projects, homework and labs, writing pre-labs reports that would help students better understand and complete their labs and help students with theorical and practical understanding of material
